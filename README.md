This GitHub repository provides an analysis of the IMDb dataset using SQL.
IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.
  
First i will analys Top 10 Revenue and Rating. My hypothesis was that Revenue would be directly proportional to Rating, That higher Ratings would result in higher Revenue. However, upon examining the top 10 Movie Revenues, the first, second, and third rankings have a Rating of 7, while the fourth ranking has a Rating of 8. This indicates that there are other factors influencing film revenue besides just Rating.

and result from viewed from a comparison of Revenue and Rating, Rating 7 has the highest total revenue.

Next, I will analyze the Release Month of movies and revenue. Films released during holiday seasons or summer typically have the potential to generate higher revenue. From the analysis results, it can be observed that December has the highest revenue because it is a holiday season with events like Christmas and New Year. Additionally, May can also be considered to have high revenue due to the summer vacation period.

Furthermore, the results of the certificate analysis indicate that PG-13 films generate the highest revenue, followed by R-rated films and PG-rated films. Notably, the revenue difference between PG-13 and R-rated films is significant, amounting to nearly 1 billion dollars.

and also, if you look at the TOP 10 Movie Revenue, almost all certificates are PG-13
