This GitHub repository provides an analysis of the IMDb dataset using SQL.
IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.
  
First i will analys Top 10 Revenue and Rating. My hypothesis was that Revenue would be directly proportional to Rating, That higher Ratings would result in higher Revenue. However, upon examining the top 10 Movie Revenues, the first, second, and third rankings have a Rating of 7, while the fourth ranking has a Rating of 8. This indicates that there are other factors influencing film revenue besides just Rating.

and result from viewed from a comparison of Revenue and Rating, Rating 7 has the highest total revenue.
